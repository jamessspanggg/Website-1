          <strong>What are cookies?</strong>
          <br />
          We may collect information using “cookies”. Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your
          computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web
          browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to
          provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our website. We use two broad categories of
          cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only
          by us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our website; and (2) third party cookies,
          which are served by service providers on our website, and can be used by such service providers, to recognize
          your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Cookies we use.</strong>

              through our website and to enable you to use some of its features. For example, they allow you to login to
              secure areas of our website and help the content of the pages you request load quickly. Without these
              cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide
              you with those services.

            <li>
              <strong>Functionality Cookies.</strong> These cookies allow our website to retain choices you make when
              you use our website, such as retaining your language preferences, retaining your login details and
              retaining the changes you make to other parts of our website which you can customize. The purpose of these
